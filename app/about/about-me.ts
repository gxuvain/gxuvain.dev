        "My name is Gauvain Palanga, I’m 19 years old, and I’m passionate about programming. Since a young age, I have always wanted to build things, and at 17, I discovered programming and fell in love with it! Today, I am focusing on web development because I’m a child of the internet, so it seems quite natural to be part of it, right? Currently, I’m in my 2nd year of BTS SIO at CCI Campus Strasbourg, and I plan to join an engineering school in the coming years to improve my skills and become a software engineer.In my free time, I also enjoy listening to music, especially hardcore music, and I love reading manga and watching anime because I’m a big fan of Japanese culture.",
